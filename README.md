# Tic-Tac-Toe

* This Project is to simulate a game of Tic Tac Toe between two players.
* The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, and players take turns to place their markers (X or O) on the grid.
* The game ends when one player wins, or when the grid is full and there is no winner.
* To place your marker you enter a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the position on the grid.
* You cannot place your marker in a position that is already occupied.
